          I am working on my first couple of technical projects, one being this
          website. I am hoping that this project will help me learn some HTML,
          CSS, and JS, and once it gets going I will try to add some ReactJS as
          well. Having to self-teach, I thought what other way than to make my
          own website, which will help me learn the skills of web-dev but also
          showcase my abilities and thoughts.

          Along with my personal page, I also am making a poker website, using
          C++ as back-end, and hopefully ReactJS as front-end. So far, I have
          done enough in the backend to fully run a poker game within XCode, but
          I have never done anything connecting backend and frontend, so that
          will be my next test.

        I am a 3rd year student at UCLA, expecting to graduate in Spring of
        2025. I have taken a few courses in C++ and Java, intro and data
        structures courses in both, and am planning to start my upper-division
        courses at UCLA in the upcoming winter quarter.<span

          <br />I have been teaching myself HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In fact,
          I have used some of those skills to make this website! Although I have
          a long way to go, I have been enjoying the journey of learning to
          become a developer!</span
